        <h2>Commission a Piece</h2>

        <p>
            Every bespoke project begins with a conversation. Whether it’s a statement dining table,
            a shelf system for a studio, a serving board made to last generations, or a piece of
            functional art — we design around your home, your routines, and your taste.
        </p>

        <p>
            We’ll guide you through proportions, joinery, and material choices so the final piece
            feels intentional — not just “custom sized”, but genuinely considered.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Typical commissions include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bespoke built-in cabinetry and fitted storage</li>
            <li>Architectural shelving systems for homes and studios</li>
            <li>Dining tables, coffee tables, benches and seating</li>
            <li>Garden pieces — outdoor tables, planters and seating</li>
            <li>Small production runs for restaurants and hospitality (boards, trays, service pieces)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            To start, send a few details (rough dimensions, where it will live, and any inspiration).
            We’ll reply with next steps, guidance, and a ballpark estimate.

            You share your idea, space, and intended use. We’ll clarify dimensions, style,

            We propose timber options, layout, and finish. For larger pieces we can supply a simple

        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <p>
            We work with responsibly sourced hardwoods chosen for beauty, strength, and character.
            Each timber brings a different mood to a piece — from dramatic grain to quiet warmth.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
            <strong>Walnut</strong> — rich, dark tone with elegant grain.
            <br />We love it for statement pieces and contrast; it brings depth and sophistication.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Oak</strong> — timeless, resilient, and highly practical.
            <br />We love it for family homes: it’s durable, forgiving, and ages beautifully.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Cherry</strong> — warm colour that deepens with time.
            <br />We love it for heirloom feel; it develops a gorgeous patina as it’s used.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Maple</strong> — pale, clean, and hard-wearing.
            <br />We love it for a bright modern look; it’s excellent for boards and everyday use.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Ash</strong> — light tone with lively, open grain.
            <br />We love it for texture and movement; it feels fresh and contemporary.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Beech</strong> — subtle grain and very stable.
            <br />We love it for practical pieces; it’s a classic for kitchen use and workshop-quality durability.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Finishes:</strong> we match the finish to the use case —
            food-safe oils and waxes for boards, and hard-wearing protective finishes for furniture.

        <h2>Bespoke FAQ</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does a commission take?</h3>
        <p>
            Most bespoke projects take 4–8 weeks depending on complexity, timber availability,
            and finishing time. Smaller pieces may be quicker.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I start a commission?</h3>
        <p>
            Message us with a short description, approximate dimensions, where it will live,
            and a couple of reference images (if you have them). We’ll guide you from there.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you work from client sketches or Pinterest references?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes — references are helpful. We’ll translate ideas into a buildable, well-proportioned design
            and suggest improvements for strength and longevity.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I choose the wood and finish?</h3>
        <p>
            Absolutely. We’ll recommend options based on the function, colour palette of your space,
            and how the piece will age over time.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are your price ranges?</h3>
        <p>
            Pricing depends on size, timber, joinery, and finishing. Once we confirm the brief,
            we’ll provide a clear quote before any build begins.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you require a deposit?</h3>
        <p>
            For bespoke commissions we typically take a deposit to secure materials and workshop time,
            with the balance due on completion before delivery.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do you handle delivery?</h3>
        <p>
            Pieces are carefully protected for transit. Delivery method depends on size — smaller items
            ship normally; larger items may require courier or arranged delivery.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I care for a chopping board?</h3>
        <p>
            Hand wash only, never soak, and re-oil when the surface looks dry. We provide care guidance
            with every board so it stays smooth and protected.
